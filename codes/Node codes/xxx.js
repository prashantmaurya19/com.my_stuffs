let a = JSON.parse(`["Arc welding is a type of welding process using an electric arc to create heat to melt and join metals. A power supply creates an electric arc between a consumable or non-consumable electrode and the base material using either direct (DC) or alternating (AC) currents.Arc welding is commonly used to join materials and is used across a lot of different industries.","Resistance welding is the joining of metals by applying pressure and passing current for a length of time through the metal area which is to be joined. The key advantage of resistance welding is that no other materials are needed to create the bond, which makes this process extremely cost effective.","Die casting is a metal casting process that is characterized by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mould cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process.","Typically, materials used for pattern making are wood, metal or plastics. Wax and Plaster of Paris are also used, but only for specialized applications. Sugar pine wood is the most commonly used material for patterns, primarily because it is soft, light, and easy to work.Two-Piece PatternMulti Piece PatternMatch Plate PatternGate Pattern","Moulding (also spelled molding in the United States though usually not within the industry), also known as coving (United Kingdom, Australia), is a strip of material with various profiles used to cover transitions between surfaces or for decoration. ... A \\"plain\\" molding has right-angled upper and lower edges","Seam welding is the joining of work pieces made of similar or dissimilar materials along a continuous seam. Seam welding can be broken down into two main techniques, resistance seam welding and friction seam welding.","Flux Core Arc Welding (FCAW) uses a tubular wire that is filled with a flux. The arc is initiated between the continuous wire electrode and the workpiece. The flux, which is contained within the core of the tubular electrode, melts during welding and shields the weld pool from the atmosphere.","Though there are numerous instances in which a defective product could injure a person, defects that give rise to supplier, seller, or manufacturer liability are categorized by three types of product defects: design defects, manufacturing defects, and marketing defects.Arithmetic Defects.Logical Defects.Syntax Defects.","When you turn on a welding machine, an electrical circuit is formed. The circuit has either a positive or negative pole, and this property is referred to as polarity. Polarity is critical for welders to understand because it directly impacts the quality and strength of the weld.","Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding is an arc welding process that uses a continuous solid wire electrode heated and fed into the weld pool from a welding gun. ... The gun feeds a shielding gas alongside the electrode helping protect the weld pool from airborne contaminants.","A cupola or cupola furnace is a melting device used in foundries that can be used to melt cast iron, Ni-resist iron and some bronzes. The cupola can be made almost any practical size. The size of a cupola is expressed in diameters and can range from 1.5 to 13 feet cupola furnace, in steelmaking, a vertical cylindrical furnace used for melting iron either for casting or for charging in other furnaces.","Acetylene is the only fuel gas suitable for gas welding because of its favourable flame characteristics of both high temperature and high propagation rates. Other fuel gases, such as propane, propylene or natural gas, produce insufficient heat input for welding but are used for cutting, torch brazing and soldering.Oxy-Acetylene welding is commonly used in joining various aircraft parts","The neutral flame is the most generally used flame for all heating and welding applications. Oxidizing flame: The oxidizing flame is produced by burning acetylene with excess oxygen.Balanced or neutral flame. Reducing or carburizing flame.Oxidising flame.","Cold forging improves the strength of the metal by hardening it at room temperature. ... Hot forging results in optimal yield strength, low hardness, and high ductility by hardening the metal at extremely high temperatures","Spot welding (or resistance spot welding) is a type of electric resistance welding used to weld various sheet metal products, through a process in which contacting metal surface points are joined by the heat obtained from resistance to electric current.This welding process is used primarily for welding two or more metal sheets together by applying pressure and heat from an electric current to the weld area.","Robot welding is commonly used for resistance spot welding and arc welding in high production applications, such as the automotive industry.Robotic welding, also known as automated welding,Reduced Waste and Less Rework in General. ... Drastically Reduced Post-Weld Cleanup.Faster, More Efficient Road to the Market.","Projection welding is actually a modification of spot welding, the pioneer resistance welding process. Projection welding is generally used for projects with thicker materials (around 0.035‚Äù and thicker). While it can be also used to join thinner metal pieces together, that tends to be a job left for spot welding"]`);
