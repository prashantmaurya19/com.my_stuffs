Q.3 ) write a program to accept the information of a book such as book number, author of the book,
     publisher and price and also display it.

code :- #include<bits/stdc++.h>
        using namespace std;

        void bookInfo(){
          vector<pair<string,string>> bookInformation;
          bookInformation.push_back({"Enter Name of the Book : ","noname"});
          bookInformation.push_back({"Enter Author of this Book : ","noname"});
          bookInformation.push_back({"Enter Publisher of this Book : ","noname"});
          bookInformation.push_back({"Enter Price of this Book : ","noname"});

          for(pair<string,string> &field: bookInformation ){
            cout<<field.first;
            getline(cin,field.second);
            cout<<endl;
          }

          for(auto field : bookInformation){
            cout << field.first.substr(6,field.first.size())  << field.second <<endl;
          }
        }

        int main() {
          bookInfo();
